## How to use it?

Clone the repository to your project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/victorcploureiro/libft_project.git libft
```

#### Mandatory:

Then use the command `make` inside the _libft_ directory to build the compiled _libft archive_ of the mandatory part of the project.

#### Bonus:

If you need the bonus part, use the command `make bonus` to include the bonus functions in the _libft archive_.

#### Remove:

To remove the objects compiled, use the command `make clean`.

#### Delete:

And, if you want to delete everything, use the command `make fclean`.

#### Declare:
To use the functions of the library you need to _include_ it in your project and compile your project with the _libft archive_.

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

```shell
gcc main.c -I ./libft ./libft/libft.a
```
